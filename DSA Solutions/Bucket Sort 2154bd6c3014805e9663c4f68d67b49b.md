Problem: sort, theory

## 🔹 Bucket Sort Explanation

- In **bucket sort**, elements are sorted on the basis of **buckets (groups)** formed based on a **specific value or property**, such as the **frequency of an element**.
- Each **bucket contains elements** that belong to a **certain range or frequency**.
- The **buckets could be sorted or unsorted**, depending on the problem.
- It is the **sorting of groups** (buckets) based on some specific **condition** that defines bucket sort.

---

### 🔄 Process

- **First**, elements are **put into their respective buckets** based on a property (e.g., value, frequency, range).
- **Then**, each bucket is **processed individually**.

```cpp
// Example: grouping numbers by frequency
bucket[1] = {elements that appear once}
bucket[2] = {elements that appear twice}
bucket[3] = {elements that appear three times}
// ...

```

---

### 🧱 Implementation

- Bucket sort is implemented using:
    - `arrays`
    - `vectors`
    - `linked lists`

---

### ⏱️ Time Complexity

- **O(n)** if the buckets **are not sorted internally**
- **O(n log n)** if buckets are sorted efficiently
- **O(n²)** in the **worst case**, when many elements fall into the same bucket and sorting becomes expensive

---

### 📊 Common Use

- Bucket sort is also used to **group elements based on ranges** (e.g., score groups, age brackets).

---

### 🧺 Final Step

- At the end, we **collect information** from **all buckets in order**, from **start to finish**, to get the final sorted or grouped result.

```cpp
for (int i = 0; i < bucket.size(); i++) {
    for (auto x : bucket[i]) {
        result.push_back(x);
    }
}

```
