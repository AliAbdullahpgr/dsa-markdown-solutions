Difficulty: easy
 : Yes
: June 23, 2025
Problem: string, two pointers
Time Taken: 20-25 minutes

## Problem:

> Given a string s, determine if it can become a valid palindrome by removing at most one character.

## 🧭 Thought Process

- This **can** be approached using dynamic programming (like for longest palindromic subsequence), but **thankfully**, that’s overkill here.
- Since we only need to check if it's a palindrome after **removing one character**, the **two-pointer approach** is perfect.
- The idea is simple:
    - Start with two pointers: `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end.
    - While characters match, keep moving inward.
    - If a mismatch occurs — you get **one chance** to skip either the left **or** the right character.
    - You check **both** and return true if **either** results in a valid palindrome.

## ✅ Key Insight:

> We must check both paths on mismatch:
> 

```cpp
return helper(left + 1, right, s) || helper(left, right - 1, s);

```

- That line right there is **chef's kiss**.
- It beautifully expresses the logic: *"If skipping the left OR the right character gives a valid palindrome, we're good."*
- I found that line on the internet and I just love it. 💖
    
    (And it’s now **burned into my brain**.)

## 🤦‍♂️ Mistakes I Made

- I initially wrote a weird nested `else if` structure to check mismatches — turned out to be **pointless**.
- Another dumb thing I did was try to solve it like **"longest palindrome substring"** by **counting frequencies** — completely wrong direction.
    - That only works when you want to rearrange into a palindrome, not check if the string **itself** is one.
    - This problem is about **structure**, not **character counts**.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Skeleton

Here’s how the final code looks using the two-pointer and helper approach:

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool helper(int left, int right, const string& s) {
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] != s[right]) return false;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    bool validPalindrome(string s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s[left] == s[right]) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                // Try skipping left or right
                return helper(left + 1, right, s) || helper(left, right - 1, s);
            }
        }
        return true; // already a palindrome
    }
};

```

## ❤️ What Makes It Beautiful

- The logic is **so elegant** — you only recurse **once**, when it’s absolutely needed.
- You don’t check every possibility — just the two **natural ones**: skip left or skip right.
- The helper handles the rest **like magic**.

## 🎯 Final Thoughts

> This was a really fun problem to solve.

> 
> I loved how simple and clean the final solution was — even though I went off-track initially.

> It taught me that:

- Frequency counts ≠ always helpful
- Don't overcomplicate with `else if`
- When two choices are possible, **check both** and trust the logic

This kind of problem reminds me why I enjoy coding — it's like solving a **logic puzzle**, and when it clicks, it just *feels right*.
